# Code Challenge

Your task is to create a confirmation modal from scratch with two buttons "confirm" and "cancel".

The confirmation modal will:

a) Fetch dummy data from a static json file (local) or the randomuser public api (randomuser.me/api)

b) Display a loading message and disable the confirm button during data fetching

c) Render the first item of your dataset in an input box

d) Changing the input box's content should display a validation message "The content has changed"

e) Clicking cancel should close the modal and reset any state

f) Optional: Create 2 tests, one that validates your data fetching outcome and another to validate the shape of the data
